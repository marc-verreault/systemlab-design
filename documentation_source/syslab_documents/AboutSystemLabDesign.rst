
About SystemLab|Design
======================

SystemLab|Design is an open-source computational engineering tool that can be used to design, 
model and simulate multi-domain systems across several technologies and/or signal regimes
(optics/photonics, electronics, analog control systems, etc.).

Built for ease-of-use and flexibility, virtual system prototype designs can be quickly built 
and analyzed to validate assumptions and predict system performance. It can also be used 
as an aid for teaching engineering principles or for sharing design ideas and concepts 
among peers.

Future releases of SystemLab|Design are planned and your feedback on the performance and 
features of this software is greatly welcome. Also, if you wish to contribute to improving
the capabilities of SystemLab|Design, please contact the primary author for further
information (marc.verreault@systemlabdesign.com)
